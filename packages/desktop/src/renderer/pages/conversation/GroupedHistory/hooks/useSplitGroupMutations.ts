/**
 * The write path for split groups: one serialized queue, and every mutation
 * reads the conversations it touches from the backend when its turn comes.
 *
 * Nothing a caller saw when it asked is trusted at execution time — not the
 * group's members, not the tags, not whether a conversation still exists.
 * The plan is built from fresh reads, written as one reconciled batch with
 * rollback, and followed by exactly one list refresh that resolves only when
 * the snapshot containing the write has landed. A conversation counts as
 * deleted only when the backend answers its own read with 404; absence from a
 * list snapshot (archived, filtered, not loaded) never is.
 *
 * Membership comes from the backend too (`readSplitGroupCensus`), never from
 * the published list: the list drops archived rows and lags another window's
 * writes, and a group counted short clears the tags of the members it can see
 * while orphaning the ones it cannot.
